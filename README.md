Things to do to make everything run properly:
1. Make sure you’re signed in with a google account for Google calendar to work.
2. Google Calendar will pull from all of the calendars you have selected in your Calendar UI. Meaning, if you have “Holidays” selected, it will add holidays to your task list.
